## 🛑 Pre-Mortem: Why This Project Might Cease Development

Before starting development, it's important to anticipate potential risks that could cause the project to be discontinued. This section documents those concerns.

### Possible Failure Points

- **Lack of Sustained Interest:** Initial enthusiasm fades, leading to abandonment.
- **Time Constraints:** Team members are unable to dedicate the necessary time due to personal or academic/professional commitments.
- **Unclear Requirements:** Misaligned expectations or shifting goals could lead to scope creep and frustration.
- **Technical Challenges:** Unforeseen bugs or architectural issues could make continued development impractical.
- **Poor User Adoption:** If users do not engage with the product as expected, motivation to continue may drop.
- **Team Dynamics:** Lack of collaboration or communication could halt progress.

> 💡 *Mitigation Plan:* Keep stakeholders aligned through regular check-ins, prioritize achievable goals, and document the development process clearly.

## 📦 Scope Management: Keeping It Small and Contained

This project intentionally limits its features to remain maintainable, testable, and deliverable.

### Scope Guidelines

- **Core-Only Features:** Only develop features that serve the core functionality. Nice-to-haves are deferred or discarded.
- **One Problem, One Solution:** Avoid feature bloat. Each function should solve a specific, necessary problem.
- **Short Milestones:** Break development into small, self-contained releases.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Rely on as few external libraries or tools as possible to reduce complexity.
- **🕐 One-Week MVP Rule:** If you can't build a functional **Minimum Viable Product** (MVP) within one week, the scope is too large — reduce it until an MVP is achievable in that time frame.

> 🎯 *Goal:* A lightweight, usable, and well-tested solution that fulfills its original purpose without trying to be everything.

## ✅ Post-Mortem: Lessons Learned

Upon completion (or discontinuation) of the project, reflect on what went well and what could be improved and archive the repo.

### What Went Well

- _e.g., "Kept scope limited and delivered MVP on time"_
- _e.g., "Codebase remained clean and modular"_
- _e.g., "Team communication was consistent and productive"_

### What Could Have Gone Better

- _e.g., "Initial setup took longer than expected due to environment issues"_
- _e.g., "Underestimated effort needed for testing and debugging"_

### Key Takeaways

- _e.g., "Planning for the worst helped avoid several pitfalls"_
- _e.g., "Feature creep is best handled with clear boundaries and team buy-in"_
